## Docs & Blog post

My previous goal with this project was to learn audio programming. I wrote
about it in [this blog post](https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/).
Since until then, a [cambrian
explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambrian_explosion&oldid=952135228)
of webassembly-based browser languages have appeared, I'm currently trying to
make WASM SYNTH work properly again.
